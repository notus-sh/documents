# Writing for the Web


## Reading on the internet

On a screen, the eye follows a random trajectory:

One should therefore guide the reader with a structured text (titles, subtitles) that attracts the eye (and its heavy, sticky characteristics) and allows us to communicate the maximum amount of information at a single glance.

We typically refer to search engines as the **blindest web users**, because they are only able to index content that appears as text. We must therefore accommodate their methods so that they are able to analyse and index your content in the best way.

The care that you bring to the writing of content on your site is a fundamental element of its success, both in terms of search ranking and for your audience. Without pretending to be a bible of writing for the web, this guide will walk you through some advice for best practice.


## Writing for the Web

### Start at the end

**Get straight to the point**. Avoid introducing a subject with an ambiguous welcoming paragraph or foreword. A text for the web should be written "upside down", presenting **above all the most essential points**, before developing them below. In this way, the Internet user quickly accesses the useful information, then they will progress to read the areas that interest them.

Your introduction should not be more than a short paragraph, but it must summarise the essential information. It should be possible to read this in isolation, as a synopsis. The rest of the article only exists to provide further details.

### Adapt your tone to your audience

**Capture the essence** of the people you are writing for. It is important to use a tone of voice that has been **carefully tailored** so that your readers will not be put off by a site with overly formal language, or on the other hand language that’s too familiar. Adopt **a personal style** that is neither too impersonal or commercial, so that you can easily communicate your points to the reader.

Avoid too many repetitions, which will make the text flabby, instead make full use of the range of language that’s relevant to your subject. As well as making the reading more fluid, in this way your page will have a greater chance of appearing in a variety of search results.

People read half as quickly on a screen than when on a piece of paper, therefore **be clear and concise, without being curt**. The objective is the same as in journalistic writing: to provide the information as quickly as possible.

The English language and a few good habits provide you with all the tools you need for arranging your text in keeping with these two objectives.

#### Be concise

- **Use short sentences**  
  Don’t use more than 15 or 20 words. It’s better to write two short sentences than one that’s long and too complex.
- **Use the active voice** rather than the passive.  
  "The cat eats the mouse" is more direct than "the mouse is being eaten by the cat".
- **Use positive phrasing** rather than negative.
  Instead of "the swimming pool isn’t closed", write "the swimming pool is open".
- **Keep it simple** and avoid talking around a subject.  
  Instead of saying "an excessive number" of words say "too many". Rather than saying "I’ll get in contact with your co-worker", say "I’ll call him".
- **Connect verbs to their counterpart**.  
  For example "I went, despite the rain, to do some shopping in town" requires more effort from the reader than "Despite the rain, I went to do some shopping in town".
- **Write as directly as possible**.  
  Instead of saying "this information will be utilized in identification of the target audience" say "this information will identify the target audience".
- **Avoid subordinate clauses, interjections, sentences in brackets, the semi-colon and the colon** where they are being used as a means to provide additional information or a pause for breath in a sentence that is too long.

#### Be clear

- **Avoid marketing language**
- **Avoid jargon** wherever possible.
- **Use concrete examples**  
  Nothing makes your point better than a good example. Avoid metaphors that can be misinterpreted.
- **Use objective times and dates**  
  To ensure the relevance of your content, use "in December 2017" rather than "last month".
- **Avoid clogging your sentences with acronyms, abbreviations or numerals** which can rapidly lose readers.

### Structure your points

**Break your text into paragraphs** to separate ideas. **Organise your text into sections** and sub-sections that you can draw attention to with subtitles.

**Create space and use formatting tools** to make your content readable on a screen (titles, subtitles, bold text, bullet points).

Internet users are generally happy to move diagonally across a page in order to quickly get a sense of the content, before dwelling longer if they consider it interesting. A clearly structured text will make this task easier for them and will create a higher chance of attracting their attention.

#### Respect semantics

The HTML language, which is used to describe webpages, provide a set of tags that allow for the content to be structured in a way that’s understandable for web browsers, screen readers and search engines. Each one of these tags is a precise signifier for how the text will function upon the page (title, link, quotations, etc.).

Editor formatting tools will help you to insert these tags into your content, but these should be **used for their purpose and not just for show**. For example:

- A title or subtitle should not simply be a paragraph put in a bold font. It should be given the appropriate formatting for its status within the content.
- Where a block of quotation contains text extracted from another source, it is wise to cite that source and to provide a link where possible.

On the other hand, just because a paragraph has the appearance you want, that doesn’t mean that it has been correctly formatted. For example:

- A bullet point list is not simply a series of lines all beginning with an asterisk. Use the "Bullet list" editor’s tool, which will attach the appropriate tags in HTML.
- Just because the titles appear in capital letters on your webpage, doesn’t mean that you should understand them as having been written in UPPER CASE.

Sometimes the style of a website is automatically applied to your content. ­­­This type of forced formatting can make content less comprehensible for screen-readers and search engines and can be harmful if it is re-used in other media.

### Make titles work for you

Titles are one of the more important areas on your webpages. Naturally given precedence by their formatting, they allow visitors to understand where they are within the text as they are scrolling. In the same way, they are given great importance when considered by search engines, therefore you should try to subtly slip in some keywords.

The main title of an article (headline) must be carefully chosen. It should ideally:

- Be short, between four and ten words.
- Be clear.
- Use language that the public will understand.
- Not contain acronyms or idioms.
- Should be engaging and inviting.
- Contain keywords.  
  Search engines attach to the titles of your content in order to index webpages. Re-use these keywords within the body of the text to reinforce the coherence of the message.
- Describe the contents of the page as clearly as possible and signal value. Create anticipation for the content below.
- Have a stand-alone message.  
  Due to the use of search engines, internet users can land directly on any given page, they should be able to immediately understand where they are.

### Illustrate your content

Use photos, graphs and graphics to illustrate and support your subject matter. These images are often more effective than lengthy sentences and bring a new dimension to any webpage.

Prioritise images that are informative. Wherever possible, include a concise caption to give the image context.

Whenever you insert an image in your content, you should always remember to **specify an alternative text**. This will be displayed when the image is not available or has not yet been loaded by the browser. It is also used by screen-readers to describe the image to users who are not able to see clearly and by search engines to identify your content. It should therefore be **short but intelligible and clearly related to the content of the image**.

By the same token, mould the name of your files to their contents in order to improve later referencing. An image named "Sydney-Central-Platform-2015.jpg" will be more easily identified by search engines than "15896672SydCent.jpg". It’s recommended to use dashes to separate multiple words rather than spaces and to avoid accented characters, as in URLS.

#### Illustrate without overloading

The loading speed of a page is a crucial factor in the user experience of your site, in particular if they are accessing it from a mobile device (smartphone, tablet or portable computer).

A page containing a large number of images, or images that have not been compressed, can quickly become difficult to load. In order to avoid this, some simple rules to follow:

- **Use images that are of a good size**  
  It’s useless to insert an image taken with the latest, top-of-the-line gadget if it’s only going to appear at a reduced size. Consider reducing your images to the required dimensions before putting them online.
- **Use the correct image format**  
  A photo is often less bulky when it is saved as a **jpg**. The **png** format is more suitable for graphics or drawings comprised of flat colours. If your image is animated, you should use the **gif** format. When in doubt, use **jpg**.
- **Optimise your images in order to reduce their size**  
  By removing useless information from the content of your images, it’s possible to save up to 50% on the size of your file.

### Link your content

Use hypertext links to:

- Reference your sources
- Support your content (for example, making a link to a definition, rather than writing it out)
- Link back to pre-existing articles

When you create a link, you should check that its wording and also its title (the text that appears when it’s hovered over) is relevant. **It is always possible to write a sentence differently in order to avoid bulky links such as "Click here".**

In terms of referencing, some links will work better than others. In fact, search engines base their results not only on the text and the title of a webpage, but also the links that are pointing towards it. You should ensure wherever possible that the title of the link matches the landing page.

### Bring something more

Your site will not interest your readers if it doesn’t convey **relevant, valuable information**. Except when offering exclusive information about your products or services, include in your content an analysis or a personal opinion on the relevant subjects.

If you only want to repeat information that’s available on another site, just use your Facebook page or Twitter account.

### Take time to review your content

There is nothing more frustrating than a website chock-full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. So take your time to carefully read over your text and then correct it.

Equally, make sure to respect the typographical rules that apply to the English language, notably:

- With the exception of acronyms, words written in capitals are not allowed. On the Internet, they are generally interpreted as shouting.
- Follow punctuation spacing rules:
  - No space before and only one space after a comma, full stop, ellipsis, colon, semicolon, question mark or exclamation mark.
  - No space before or after an apostrophe, an hyphen and a slash.
  - Dashes are preceded and followed by a space.
  - One space on the outside, no space on the inside of parentheses, square brackets and double quotes.

Carefully check that your links are working correctly and that your images are sitting well within the content.

**Prioritise content quality** over quantity, both in terms of style and substance, in order to attract new visitors.

### Copyright

Always be sure to cite (and link, where possible) the source of your information or media.

With regards to an image or a video, make sure to check in advance that the author has authorized its use. This information is generally to be found close to the media in question or in the legal terms of the website.

### Define your editorial policy

Especially if there are multiple authors who will be involved in writing your blog, it’s important to define an editorial policy that specifies the topics to be covered and the aims for each.


## Points to remember

- The attention of someone reading on the web is short-lived: you have to grab the attention of an Internet user by first of all presenting the conclusion.
- A reader’s eye movement is not linear. Therefore it’s important to create an eye-catching layout that guides reading.
- Internet users are impatient. An image or video that takes too long to load will cause them to leave.
- Content that’s optimized for your readers will improve your search engine rankings.
- Prioritise quality of content over quantity, in style and substance, in order to attract new visitors.

### Taking things further

- Monitor the traffic on your website in order to judge the effect of your new publications.
- Include buttons for sharing on social media networks in order to generate new users.
